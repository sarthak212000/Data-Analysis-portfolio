# Data-analysis-portfolio
Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!

I am excited to showcase my skills as a data analyst and business analyst through the completion of four diverse projects.

My first project delves into data exploration with a detailed analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. I utilized various data visualization techniques to uncover key insights and trends in the spread of the virus.

Next, I showcased my proficiency in Excel by completing a portfolio project on a different topic. I applied advanced Excel functions and tools to manipulate and analyze data, resulting in valuable insights and recommendations.

I then put my SQL skills to the test by working with the Zomato dataset. I implemented complex queries and joins to extract relevant information and uncover patterns in the data.

Finally, I tackled a data cleaning project using the Nashville Housing dataset. I employed data cleansing techniques to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data, ultimately leading to more reliable and actionable insights.

Overall, these projects demonstrate my ability to work with various types of data and tools, as well as my aptitude for uncovering insights and trends that can inform business decisions. I am confident that my skills and experience make me a valuable asset to any organization and I look forward to the opportunity to apply my abilities in a professional setting.
